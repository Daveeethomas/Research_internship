# Research_internship

To use this github page to generate results you will have to download the GWAS dataset which can be acquired by sending me an email on David.pg.thomas@gmail.com, since this is not available for public use.

Further all files are available and all files are downloaded already that are needed to run the scripts in the single Jupiter notebook called make_PPI_residues_dataframe.ipynb


Feel free to ask any further questions!
